  # The network section covers network configuration :)
  "network": {
    # A list of downstream servers listening for our messages.
    # logstash-forwarder will pick one at random and only switch if
    # the selected one appears to be dead or unresponsive
    "servers": [ "ec2-52-37-212-243.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7003" ],

    # The path to your client ssl certificate (optional)
    #"ssl certificate": "./logstash-forwarder.crt",
    # The path to your client ssl key (optional)
    "ssl key": "/opt/logstash-forwarder/logstash-forwarder_notsecure.key",

    # The path to your trusted ssl CA file. This is used
    # to authenticate your downstream server.
    "ssl ca": "/opt/logstash-forwarder/logstash-forwarder_notsecure.crt",

    # Network timeout in seconds. This is most important for
    # logstash-forwarder determining whether to stop waiting for an
    # acknowledgement from the downstream server. If an timeout is reached,
    # logstash-forwarder will assume the connection or server is bad and
    # will connect to a server chosen at random from the servers list.
    "timeout": 15
  },

### On paths-entry per NMS module should be fine...
### 'nms-logs' is a known log-format, check / compare with GEMP log
### If you're not sure whether your log-files will work with Logstashs config, please check first

  # The list of files configurations
  "files": [
    # An array of hashes. Each hash tells what paths to watch and
    # what fields to annotate on events from those paths.

        # single paths are fine
        "/usr/share/tomcat8/logs/apps/*.log.1",
        # globs are fine too, they will be periodically evaluated
        # to see if any new files match the wildcard.
        "/usr/share/tomcat8/logs/apps/*.log"
